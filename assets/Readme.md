Horiseon Website Update Project
________________________________

I was asked to revamp Horiseon's Webpage to make the html more accessable, and at the same time eliminate repetitive code cluttering the css.
The changes that I made to the html and css will make the job of coders who come after me easier.

Through updating most of the existing div tags to semantic tags, it makes the nature of the divisions within the webpge more accessible to understanding. 
The appearance of the site was essentially unchanged, but the updates that I made to the code will streamline changes that need to be made in the future. 

I struggled initially with replacing the div tags becuase I believed that what I needed to do was more complex that it actually was. With the help of some online resources and a tutor session I realized that it is actually a relatively straightforward operation. 

This tutorial from w3schools.com was very helpful:
